## To Do
* Move Mute function into seperate .js file
* GitHub pages deployment issue with assetts not in root file, i.e '/sprites'
* Make compatable with other browsers - selecting DOM elements different
* Organize file structure for .js .css and img files
* Mobile functionality - mobile touch works, display still offset
* Game must be refreshed if Window is resized
